Bokeh in Jupyter Notebook
===============================

Welcome to [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/) in Jupyter Notebook!

Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library for large datasets that natively uses the latest web technologies. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the style of Protovis/D3, while delivering high-performance interactivity over large data to thin clients.

These Jupyter notebooks provide useful Bokeh examples and a tutorial to get started. You can visualize the rendered Jupyter notebooks [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/bokeh/bokeh-notebooks) or download the repository and execute `jupyter notebook` from your terminal.

Please visit the [Bokeh web page](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest) for more information and full documentation.
